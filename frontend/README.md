# AI Voice Chat Frontend

This is a feature-rich, responsive frontend for an AI voice chat application built with React. It allows users to interact with an AI assistant through either text or voice, providing a seamless and interactive conversational experience.



---

## Features

This application comes with a comprehensive set of features designed for a modern voice-first AI experience:

### üó£Ô∏è Dual Interaction Modes
-   **Text Input**: A classic chat input field for typing messages.
-   **Voice Input**: Record your voice directly in the browser. The app captures the audio, allows for playback, and sends it for transcription.

### üîä Core Audio Functionality
-   **In-Browser Recording**: Uses the `MediaRecorder` API to capture microphone input securely.
-   **Audio Playback**: Both the user's recorded audio and the AI's generated response can be played back directly in the chat interface.
-   **Automatic Playback**: The latest AI audio response plays automatically for a hands-free experience.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Seamless API Integration
-   **Transcription**: Sends recorded audio to a backend for Speech-to-Text (STT) conversion.
-   **Chat Logic**: Sends user messages (text or transcribed) and conversation history to a backend to get an intelligent response.
-   **Speech Synthesis**: Sends the AI's text response to a backend for Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion, receiving audio data back.

### ‚ú® Modern User Experience
-   **Real-time Status Updates**: The UI displays the current status of the application, such as "Recording...", "Transcribing...", "Assistant is thinking...", keeping the user informed.
-   **Performance Metrics**: Displays the time taken for both transcription and speech synthesis, offering insights into system performance.
-   **Dynamic Chat History**: A clean, auto-scrolling chat window that displays the conversation in a familiar, organized way.
-   **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles and displays errors, such as microphone permission denial or API failures.
-   **Conversation Reset**: A simple one-click button to clear the current conversation and start fresh on both the client and server.

### üé® Sleek & Responsive Design
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, utility-first design.
-   **SVG Icons**: Includes a set of clean, self-contained SVG icons for a polished look and feel.
-   **Responsive Layout**: The interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Setup and Installation

To run this frontend, you need to have a compatible backend server running and have Node.js and `npm` (or `yarn`) installed.

### 1. Backend Server Requirements

This frontend is designed to communicate with a backend that exposes the following API endpoints:

-   **`POST /transcribe`**:
    -   **Request**: `multipart/form-data` with an `audio` file (`audio.wav`).
    -   **Response**: JSON `{"text": "transcribed user text", "stt_time": 0.5}`.
-   **`POST /chat`**:
    -   **Request**: JSON `{"conversation": [...history], "new_message": "user's latest message"}`.
    -   **Response**: JSON `{"response": "The AI assistant's text response"}`.
-   **`POST /speak`**:
    -   **Request**: JSON `{"text": "The AI assistant's text response"}`.
    -   **Response**: JSON `{"audio_url": "base64-encoded-wav-string", "tts_time": 0.8}`.
-   **`POST /reset`**:
    -   **Request**: No body required.
    -   **Response**: A success status code (e.g., 200 OK).

### 2. Frontend Setup

Follow these steps to get the React application running:

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**Step 3: Configure API Base URL**
Open `src/App.jsx` and set the `API_BASE_URL` to point to your backend server:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = "http://your-backend-server:8000";
```

**Step 4: Start the Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified host).

## Usage Instructions
